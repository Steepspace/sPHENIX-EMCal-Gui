#+TITLE: Readme

* Description
A graphical interface to monitor the bias voltages on the interface boards of the EMCal.

** Legend
*** Green: Bias voltage good and in the expected range.
*** Red: Bias voltage is very low. Run recovery procedure for getting the biases back up. Notify the experts if the behavior persists.
*** Orange: Bias voltage lower than expected. Run recovery procedure for getting the biases back up. Notify the experts if the behavior persists.
*** Purple: Bias voltage is much higher than expected. Run recovery procedure for getting the biases back up. Notify the experts if the behavior persists.
*** Grey: Known issue. Ignore.

* Instructions
If the GUI closes it can be recovered as follows:
1) Open Terminal.
2) Execute the command:
#+begin_src bash
./EMCal-Bias-Monitor/emcalsector.py
#+end_src

* Usage
Can be run on sphenix-slow@control1, phnxrc@daq01 and phnxrc@daq02.
** Default
Shows the GUI in the minimalistic form.
#+begin_src bash
./emcalsector.py
#+end_src

Example:

** Verbose
Shows the GUI with the bias voltage values.
